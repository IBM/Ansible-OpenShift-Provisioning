## Master Playbook (site.yaml)
### Overview
* Use this playbook to run all required playbooks (0-7) all at once.
### Outcomes
* At the end you will have an OpenShift cluster deployed and first-time login credentials.
### Notes
* Not recommended for first-time users, as the playbook will likely fail out in various ways along the way because of incorrectly set variables, or any number of other reasons.
* As you personalize and customize your playbooks, this playbook is more useful.
